# MacOS Setup

Some configuration files to get up and running on a new mac more quickly.

# Homebrew

Homebrew can install things from the MAC App Store, Cask installs from the internet, and brew installs from the Homebrew registry using `brew bundle` and a [Brewfile](Brewfile).

# Fisher

Fisher stores a list of installed plugins in `~/.config/fish/fishfile`, so I've copied my current [fishfile](fishfile) here.
